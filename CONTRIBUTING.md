# Workflow

## Building Devs-Portfolio-App
For new members please ask for the Config files [Here](https://github.com/Madonahs/Devs-Portfolio-App), the app can not run without them. The following are some additional information and guidelines to help you contribute easily.

I will encourage that you go through the app first and see what functions are availabe and what is missing and you can suggest a fix if you notice a bug or a missing function. The project is friendly and you should feel free to bring in new ideas. 

## Have Any Questions
If you have any questions and would love more info please feel free to email me here -- madonahsyombua@gmail.com. See what has been done on the project board,- [Board](https://github.com/Madonahs/Devs-Portfolio-App/projects/2)

### Warnings
Please make sure you run the app and check for warning and errors.If the warnings can be suppressed you can use @SuppressWarnings("type-of-warning").
