# GrowWithGoogleTeamProject
Grow With Google Scholarship Team Project.

subject to change.

This is a TEAM PROJECT.

Things we're targeting in Stage 1:
1. Create a place holder for our project. GitHub is one of the choices.
2. All interested members would fork from the directory and work on their individual branches.
3. These branches would serve as pull requests for version upgrades.
4. Initial setup for the app creation is to create an empty activity to have text fields and buttons for login and signing up options. Two approaches for framework creation:
   a) Use local database sqlite to check for username and password entry & add/register a new user.
    b) Use local node or other server to fetch response for HTTP queries to serve login/register request.
5. Till the final server and API format gets frozen(accepted and set up), everyone must be able to launch the app and fetch a connection through HTTP URL.
6. First cut of the app must be able to make HTTP requests, and get a response as a handshake, not necessarily getting full payload response.
7. Initial mock up screens to be prepared for first cut.
